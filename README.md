# Patchwork-runtime
An experiment to run the [Patchwork](https://github.com/PatchworkMC) process entirely at run-time, allowing users to
simply put forge mods in their Fabric `mods` folder.

### Note
You have to put both the patchwork-api and fabric-api in `run/mods`, since we can't nest jijs. After that, just drop
forge mods into the same folder.
